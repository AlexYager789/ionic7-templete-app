To use this component, you need to include the following code in your HTML document, where you want the translated text to appear:

```html
<ion-label>{{ "HTML element name | translation function name"(translate) }}</ion-label>
```

In the i18s folder, you should add the translation strings for different languages. For example, in ru.json, you can have:

```json
"Inbox": "Входящие"
```

And in en.json, you can have:

```json
"Inbox": "Inbox"
```

To translate to English, you can use the following translation function:

```html
<ion-label>{{ "Inbox" | translate }}</ion-label>
```

This will display "Inbox" in English.
