# Development of the "Mood Calendar" Component

>This component was developed to provide the ability to view mood statistics.


>The development of this component uses the Angular HTTP client for requesting and receiving text data.

To use this component, you need to include in the HTML document a line with HTML text like this: <ion-label>{{ "HTML element name" | "language change function name"(translate) }}</ion-label>
You also need to go to the mood-calendar folder and add translatable elements, following this example: in ru.json "Inbox": "Входящие", in en.json "Inbox": "Inbox".
