# My front-layout component

- The component shows all the components that exist.
- This component was designed for convenient use of other components, to quickly find the desired component.
- To add a component you need to write data to Component_Item[] in the front-layout.components.ts file, namely 
c_name:"Title", c_desc:"Brief description", link:"Link to component". 

- For example:
{c_name: "Inbox", c_desc: "inbox",link:"/folder/inbox" }.
