# Development of the camera component

>This component was developed for photographing and saving photographic materials.

To implement this component, ionic methods such as:
- (ion-input) are used to enter variables. It itself is located in (ion-item) and contains several variables inside itself, for the user to work with it fully and correctly. These include: 
- (label) is used to name the field
- (type) is used to assign its type
- (color) is used to select the color of the text input backlight.

What needs to be Done:
- Transfer photo saving to photogallery
- Optimize the operation of the component
