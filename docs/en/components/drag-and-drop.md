# Drag and Drop Component Documentation

This component demonstrates a drag-and-drop feature implemented using Angular. It allows users to drag items from one list and drop them into another, enabling reordering or transferring of items.

The component leverages Angular's CDK Drag and Drop module from the Angular Material library, which simplifies implementing drag-and-drop interfaces.


## Key Features

- Drag entire items between two lists.
- Reorder items in the same list.
- Real-time updates to the underlying data models after drag-and-drop actions.
- Visual feedback to indicate the drag state.
